Postfix is an alternative to the widely used Sendmail Message Transfer Agent (MTA).

The procedures in this topic will work with Linux, macOS, or Unix. 

Prerequisite:
Uninstall sendmail from the server

Installation:
- Install Postfix

Install a SASL authentication package.
- libsasl2-modules (Debian/ubuntu)
- cyrus-sasl-plain (Redhat based system)

Verify email Address:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html


General steps:
1] At the command line, type the following command:

sudo postconf -e "relayhost = [email-smtp.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com]:587" \
"smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes" \
"smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous" \
"smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd" \
"smtp_use_tls = yes" \
"smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt" \
"smtp_tls_note_starttls_offer = yes"

Note:
replace the email-smtp.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com endpoint as per the region where you are setting up the ses


2] In a text editor, open the file /etc/postfix/master.cf. Search for the following entry:

-o smtp_fallback_relay=

If you find this entry, comment it out by placing a # (hash) character at the beginning of the line. Save and close the file. 

3]In a text editor, open the file /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd. If the file doesn't already exist, create it. 

4] Add the following line to /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
[email-smtp.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com]:587 access-key:secrete_key

Note:
Replace SMTPUSERNAME and SMTPPASSWORD with your SMTP username and password, respectively. Your SMTP user name and password aren't the same as your AWS access key ID and secret access key. For more information about credentials, see Obtaining Your Amazon SES SMTP Credentials. 

5]At a command prompt, type the following command to create a hashmap database file containing your SMTP credentials: 
sudo postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

6] Restrict the above created files:
sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db

7]Tell Postfix where to find the CA certificate (needed to verify the Amazon SES server certificate)

   - If you use Amazon Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or a related distribution, type the following command:
       sudo postconf -e 'smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt'

   - If you use Ubuntu or a related distribution, type the following command:
       sudo postconf -e 'smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'

   - If you use macOS, you can generate the certificate from your system keychain. To generate the certificate, type the following command at the command line:
        sudo security find-certificate -a -p /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain > /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt


   - After you generate the certificate, type the following command:
       sudo postconf -e 'smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt'

8]update in main.cf file
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt

8]restart postfix:
